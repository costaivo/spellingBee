# Spelling Bee
A Spelling Bee App, to help kids practice their spellings for spelling Bee Competitions


## History

A while ago i was helping my child in practicing his spellings for the Spelling Bee Competition. After spending about 30mins helping him learn his spellings. Then i got an idea of creating chits on which i wrote all the spellings and randomly started asking him to spell the words. While doing so, i realized i could put my programming skills into use and create a small app to help him practice on his own. I coded the first version of this app in about 2.5hrs. 

Ideas kept flowing and soon i started spending more time in developing the application and making it more engaging for kids to have fun while practicing their spellings.
